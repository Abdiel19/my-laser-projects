Use your laser cutter to cut the provided sheet SVG files. Make sure you do not enable the label, background, or guideline layers. The layers in the SVG files are stacked by cutting order.

You will also need:

 * 1/8 inch diameter round dowel
 * 3/16 inch diameter round dowel
 * 1/8 inch width square dowel
 * toothpicks
 * small round file
 * small square or triangle file
 * small flat file
 * flush cutters
 * super glue

Follow the assembly instructions provided as images. The SVG files indicate the name of each piece if the "labels" layer is visible.

If something doesn't fit, or require more freedom in movement, use the tools to enlarge the oriface or grind the surface.
